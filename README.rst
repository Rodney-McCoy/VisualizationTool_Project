VisualizationTool_Project
=========================

The old folder contains code implimented form Sprint 1 that was not used in this sprint (MVC)

Two additions were made to this project in this Sprint:

Main.java runs the GUI that serves as a proof of concept GUI for our sprint. It does not need
the files in the old folder to run. There were difficulties when trying to connect this GUI to 
the MVC so we decided not to use it as its creator was unable to help with this sprint.  The GUI 
shows a visualization of how we hope the code to work. Source code comments explain
how the actual functionality is intended to be implimented.

The AlgorithmsTest.java includes junits tests of the algorithms in Algorithms.java. 
  
In summary, there are 2 runnables: Main.java in the GUI folder and AlgorithmsTest.java.
