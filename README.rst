=========================
VisualizationTool_Project
=========================

Two additions were made to this project in this Sprint:

The GUI folder contains a main to the proof of concept GUI for the visualization tool
These files need to be run with node, graph, and link .java files.  There were complications
when trying to connect this GUI to the MVC as changes need to be made to the MVC.  The GUI is
runnable and shows a visualization of how we hope the code to work. Source code comments explain
how the actual functionality is intended to be implimented.  A few methods were created as expected,
when abondoning the MVC framework.

The AlgorithmsTest.java includes junits tests of the algorithms in Algorithms.java. 
  

In summary, there are 2 runnables: Main.java in the GUI folder and AlgorithmsTest.java.
